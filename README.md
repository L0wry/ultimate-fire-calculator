A suggestion from me which I believe other FIRErs would be interested in, is some sort of goalseek function or alert relating to where to set pension contributions so as not to hit the LTA. In reality who knows what the LTA will be in a few decades, but it's still something to be mindful of when saving!

Can you graph the net worth with monthly expenses deducted after retirement? Or maybe allow a set retirement in years then start expense deductions

The ability to edit expenses


Start drawdown from year x. new graph => net worth - drawdown % 



### Other ideas
- Add debts such as loans, credit cards etc
